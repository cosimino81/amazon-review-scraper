"After 20 returns","Just writing a rare review on these . I love Nike’s but my feet don’t usually. So I’ve ordered and returned a lot. Tried again lol and these ARE AMAZING comfortable.

"Half size up :)","I have only run in them a couple of times, but so far they feel great. I normally wear a size 9, and I ordered a 9.5, and I’m glad I did. There is plenty of room, but not too much. The only thing that will take me getting used to is that they are slightly bulkier than my ASICS.

"Great!","I'm not really big into sneakers but I'm a fan of Nike and their activewear. When I saw these a few months ago, I HAD to have them. I usually only buy shoes that are black or black & white so this was a change for me. They're on the pricey side so for months I watched the price yo-yo. Right after the holidays they were the cheapest I've seen them, so I bought them! I had received them a few days ago. I wore them for the first time today and they were great! I'm normally a size 7 in women's shoes and one reviewer mentioned going up a half size, which ended up being a good idea so I ordered the 7. 5. Definitely very comfortable and I feel like it gives me a little bit of height (I'm 5'0 so I like it!). I love the colors! Can't wait to break them in!","13 Jan 2020","Size: 7.5 Color: Black/White/Mtlc Cool Grey","","Yes","Alana Marie","5.0","Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes","https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2&sortBy=recent

"Haven't tried on Nike's in years","Not a good fit for me.  The sole material is incredible stiff (hardly bendable). Compared to my old Gel Nimbus 16 Asics little front foot support for impact.  The heel fits fine ... shoe is tight around top of foot and toe box. I feel an odd bump in the ball of foot cushion.  Another half size up MIGHT do it (I always wear a 7 in running shoes and that's what I ordered), if it weren't for the other issues. I own a pair the original Nike's Lady running shoes from the 80's.

"Great shoes.","Not shoes I wanted, but needed a pair I could actually walk in due to being pregnant and keeping up with my 2yr old outside. So I ordered these was bummed out till I received them I fell in love instantly I get so many compliments and when I say how much they cost people are wowed at how such great shoes are pricy, but not costing a arm and leg like most. However they do rub a little and are tight around the ankles (My ankles have not swollen yet only 3m along) SO I would least suggest socks that go a little above your ankle at least. I got a size 9 they are a little big on me so I would say order a size down or if you like the extra room get your normal size.","14 May 2019","Size: 9 Color: White/Metallic Silver/Dark Grey","","Yes","Shannon Jones","4.0","Nike Women's Reax Run 5 Running Shoes","https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Womens-Reax-Running-Shoes/product-reviews/B07ZPL752N/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_next_2?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&pageNumber=2&sortBy=recent

"True: Not a typical Nike fit","This shoe is awesome. I usually get half a size larger in Nike because they are typically narrow and short.

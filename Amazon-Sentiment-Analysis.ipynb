There is plenty of room, but not too much. The only thing that will take me getting used to is that they are slightly bulkier than my ASICS.

I usually only buy shoes that are black or black & white so this was a change for me. They're on the pricey side so for months I watched the price yo-yo. Right after the holidays they were the cheapest I've seen them, so I bought them! I had received them a few days ago. I wore them for the first time today and they were great! I'm normally a size 7 in women's shoes and one reviewer mentioned going up a half size, which ended up being a good idea so I ordered the 7. 5. Definitely very comfortable and I feel like it gives me a little bit of height (I'm 5'0 so I like it!). I love the colors! Can't wait to break them in!\n",

The heel fits fine ... shoe is tight around top of foot and toe box. I feel an odd bump in the ball of foot cushion.  Another half size up MIGHT do it (I always wear a 7 in running shoes and that's what I ordered), if it weren't for the other issues. I own a pair the original Nike's Lady running shoes from the 80's. They STILL fit perfectly!\n",

So I ordered these was bummed out till I received them I fell in love instantly I get so many compliments and when I say how much they cost people are wowed at how such great shoes are pricy, but not costing a arm and leg like most. However they do rub a little and are tight around the ankles (My ankles have not swollen yet only 3m along) SO I would least suggest socks that go a little above your ankle at least. I got a size 9 they are a little big on me so I would say order a size down or if you like the extra room get your normal size.\n",

I’m not that happy about this shoe (Nike Reax Run 5)  I should not have to pay for a pair of shoes that’s already damaged! When I get shoes I take care of them and don’t like marks and scuffs so all in all I’m not very happy with this product I would Have never paid the amount I paid for these shoes if I would have known they were going to be damaged!!
